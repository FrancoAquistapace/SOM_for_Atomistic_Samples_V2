"""
    file_list : list
        List with the sample paths that are going to be classified
        by the SOM. If the list is empty, the program uses the
        search_pattern instead.
        
    search_pattern : str
        Search pattern for the files that are going to be 
        classified by the SOM. For example: 'feature_sample.*.config'
        
    training_file : str
        Path of the sample file used to train the SOM.
        
    features : list
        List containing the names of the features to be used.
        
    f : int or float
        Fraction of the sample data to use when training the SOM.
        Must be in the range (0,1].
                              
    sigma : int or float
        Maximum value for the sigma(t) function, which gives the
        standard deviation of a Gaussian neighborhood as a 
        function of the current iteration step.
        
    eta : int or float
        Maximum learning rate for the eta(t) function, which gives
        the learning rate as a function of the current iteration 
        step.
        
    N : int
        Number of output neurons of the SOM network, i.e. number 
        of groups in which to classify the atoms of the sample.
        
    Batched : bool
        Whether to use batched learning or not.
        
    Batch_size : int
        Size of the batches used in the training process.
